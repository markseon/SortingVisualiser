# Sorting Visualiser

This application allows you to visualise several sorting algorithms. The app allows you to specify several parameters including the playback speed and amount of numbers to be sorted.
The display is resizable, and the background and bar colours can be customised using the GUI. The user can also choose to save their settings, which will be automatically loaded
on startup.
